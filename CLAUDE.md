# Using muckdb (guide for Claude / coding agents)

please keep the latest version running whenever possible.

`muckdb` is a drop-in wrapper around the `duckdb` CLI that also runs a live web
UI (default <http://localhost:11000>). Anything you'd run with `duckdb`, run with
`muckdb` instead — same arguments, same stdout/exit codes — and it additionally:

- records every invocation in a live **ledger**,
- lets you browse any database it has touched (rows, search, facets, sorting,
  stats with histograms — plus correlation, time-series and junk-data tabs,
  schema, a SQL query editor, CSV/JSON export), and
- hosts **sessions**: named dashboards of panels you build from the CLI to
  present results to the human.

The first `muckdb` call starts the background server automatically. You don't
need to manage it (`muckdb start` / `--status` / `--stop` / `--display` exist if needed).

**Port.** The daemon defaults to 11000. Override it with `--port <N>` (recorded
in `MUCKDB_PORT` so the spawned daemon and every later CLI call in the same
environment agree), or by setting `MUCKDB_PORT` directly — useful for running an
isolated second instance. (The bind address is set via the `MUCKDB_BIND` env var,
loopback by default; a non-loopback bind exposes every database muckdb has touched
and prints a one-line stderr warning.)
<!-- Keep --port / MUCKDB_PORT documented HERE ONLY (agent-facing). Do NOT add it
to README.md or the installed skill (src/assets/skill/SKILL.md) — it's an
internal/testing knob, not something end users or the skill should reach for. -->

## When to use it

When you've analysed data in duckdb and want to **show the human the result**,
build a session dashboard instead of dumping text. They open one URL and get
live, interactive charts + notes that update as you post more.

## The core workflow

```sh
# 1. Tag your work so commands are grouped under a session in the ledger.
export MUCKDB_SESSION=pond-analysis

# 2. Create the session (optional --title).
muckdb session create pond-analysis --title "Pond analysis"

# 3. Do your duckdb work as normal, creating VIEWS for anything you want to chart
#    or let the human explore. (muckdb == duckdb here.)
muckdb ~/data/ponds.duckdb -c "
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW by_species AS
    SELECT species, count(*) AS n FROM readings GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY n DESC;
"

# 4. Post panels. Re-run with the same --name to UPDATE a panel in place.
muckdb session post pond-analysis --name summary --title Summary \
  --md "# Pond analysis\n\n**5 species**, ~240 readings. pH trends **down**."

muckdb session tile pond-analysis --name species --title "By species" \
  --db ~/data/ponds.duckdb --view by_species --chart bar --x species --y n

# 5. Tell the human to open the dashboard:
#    http://localhost:11000/session/pond-analysis/
```

- **Link the session to your conversation** with `--claude "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"`
  on `create`. The UUID is shown at the top of the session view and returned by
  `muckdb ls session <id>` (`claude_session`).
- **Tiles are keyed by `--name`** within a session — re-posting the same name
  replaces that panel (upsert). Use stable names so updates land in place.
- **Lay the report out, and keep it laid out.** Tiles render in post order;
  `session move` reorders one (`--up`/`--down`, `--to N` for a 1-based position,
  or `--before`/`--after TILE`). `session section --name S --title "Heading"` adds
  a heading-only tile that renders as a divider in the dashboard and as a section
  header in the contents, grouping the panels after it. A dashboard is a document,
  not an append-only log: **each time you add tiles, re-evaluate the section
  structure and reorganise** (does it need a new section? are related tiles
  adjacent? is the order still a sensible narrative?) with `session section` and
  `session move`, so readability holds as the report grows.
- **Posts are validated against the database.** A missing view, unparseable
  `--sql`, or a `--x`/`--y` that isn't a column of the result fails immediately
  with a "did you mean" suggestion and the available names — fix and re-post.
  `--no-validate` skips the check (e.g. posting before the view exists).
- `--md -` reads the markdown from stdin (good for long/heredoc content). An
  inline `--md "..."` honours `\n`/`\t` escapes (shells leave them literal
  inside double quotes), so `--md "# Title\n\nBody"` renders as real lines.
- A tile is a **view** (`--view`, references a named duckdb view) or **inline
  SQL** (`--sql`). Prefer `--view` for anything the human should be able to drill
  into — view tiles get an **explore** button that opens the faceted table
  explorer; inline-SQL tiles get a **sql** button that shows the formatted query.
- Chart kinds: `bar | stacked | line | area | scatter | pie | table | heatmap | box | map | timeline | sequence`. For
  `bar`/`line`/etc, put aggregation in the view/SQL (one row per x). If the `--x`
  column is a date/timestamp, the chart uses a real time axis automatically, drawn
  on a **UTC wall-clock** so daily/hourly buckets stay on their boundaries (a
  `DATE` day won't skew by the viewer's timezone).
- **Axis labels**: `--xlabel`/`--ylabel` set the x/y axis titles on any chart.
- **Pick the chart that packs in the most information** — don't default everything
  to single-series bars. `stacked` bars show a total *and* its composition in one
  panel; `area` (and stacked areas with multiple `--y`) show volume and how parts
  evolve over time; `line` is the go-to for **temporal data** (carries trend,
  seasonality, and multiple series on one time axis — prefer it over bars when x is
  continuous time and the *shape* matters); `scatter` shows every raw point;
  `heatmap` crosses two categorical columns and shades each cell by a value
  column — the densest way to show a metric over every (x, y) combination
  (e.g. sites per country x port speed). Shape the view with one row per pair
  (`GROUP BY x, y`) and control axis order with ORDER BY (axes follow row
  order of appearance); `box` draws one box-and-whisker per row on a shared
  scale — the way to compare distributions across groups. `--x` labels each
  box, `--y` takes exactly five columns in order `min,q1,median,q3,max`
  (aggregate in the view: `min(v), quantile_cont(v,0.25), median(v),
  quantile_cont(v,0.75), max(v)`), and `--desc` names a text column whose
  note renders under each label so every box explains itself. `map` plots
  geographic points on a compact ASCII world map: give it `--lat`/`--lon`
  columns (or name them lat/latitude & lon/lng/longitude and they're
  auto-detected), one row per point. Each grid cell with data gets a coloured
  `x` shaded by how many points fall in it, or by the average of `--value` when
  given. Don't pre-aggregate — pass the raw points (one row each); the tile bins
  them into cells itself. `--label COL` names each point in a rich hover tooltip
  (coords, count, value, and the labels of the points in that cell). A toggle at
  the top of the tile switches between the ASCII map and a **hi-fi** SVG world map
  (faded, labelled countries with the same points overlaid); the choice is
  remembered per browser. Both share the same equirectangular projection, so a
  point lands on the same coastline in either mode. **Connections/flows:** give a
  map four endpoint columns (`--from-lat`/`--from-lon`/`--to-lat`/`--to-lon`,
  one connection per row) and each row is drawn as a fluid semi-transparent arc
  between two markers — the same data overlay (markers + arcs + labels) is drawn
  over the ASCII backdrop or the hi-fi world map (whose sea has a subtle animated
  shimmer). Each arc stops just short of its markers (a small margin), takes the
  shorter way round the globe (wrapping the date line when that's closer), and its
  opacity scales with `--value` (line width is uniform). `--label` names each arc;
  labels render on a top layer with a subtle rounded pill and shift vertically to
  avoid overlapping (a leader line is drawn when one is moved). Hovering an arc or
  its label shows the same tooltip. Name each endpoint **marker** (the place at
  each end — a distinct thing from the arc's `--label`) with `--from-label`/
  `--to-label`; hovering a marker then shows that place name (they auto-detect
  `from_city`/`to_city` etc. when the flags are omitted). Themes control the arc look (opacity, connect-
  gap, arc-vs-straight, label-pill fill) — see the `arcOpacity`/`arcGap`/
  `roundLinks`/`labelBg` theme keys.
- **`timeline`** lays each view row out as a **bar** on a shared time axis, grouped
  into labelled **lanes** — muckdb's Gantt / OpenTelemetry-trace / incident view.
  One row = one bar; lane order follows first appearance (control with `ORDER BY`).
  Required: `--lane` (the row/resource, labelled in the left gutter), `--label`
  (text in the bar), `--start`, and exactly one of `--end`/`--duration`
  (`--duration` is numeric **seconds**). Optional: `--color COL` colours bars by a
  category and adds a legend (default is one palette colour per lane); `--id` +
  `--depends-on` (comma-separated parent ids) draw right-angle dependency
  connectors that cross lanes; `--event 'X|label'` adds dashed markers.
  **The axis is auto-detected:** numeric start/end → a relative-seconds axis
  (`0s`, `2m 15s`); timestamp/date → an absolute axis. **Naive timestamps are
  UTC and the axis shows the UTC wall-clock by default — not auto-local.** Set
  `muckdb format <db> <startcol> --tz local` (or an IANA zone) to shift the axis to
  that zone; the hover readout then also shows the UTC instant. The bottom axis
  draws tick marks on regular round intervals sized to the width and drops any
  label that would overlap. Overlapping bars in a lane stack into **sublanes**
  automatically. Markers show their labels in a band **above** the lanes (with a
  small triangle at the top of each), stacked if they'd collide, and are a distinct
  colour from the orange hover cursor (theme via the `--tl-marker-color/-width/-dash/-opacity`
  CSS vars). Hover anywhere for a cursor + time (local **and** UTC when `--tz` is
  set); hover a bar for a tooltip with label/lane/start→end/duration/category
  **plus every other row column** through its format — so a `--link` on an
  id/reference column becomes a clickable link in the tooltip. Supports the
  full-width toggle like tables. Shape the view as one row per bar; put a
  `--color` category, `--id`/`--depends-on`, and any extra tooltip columns in the
  SELECT.
- **`sequence`** shows **interactions between microservices** as a UML
  sequence diagram — one row per message, drawn as an arrow between two
  participant lifelines. Required: `--from`/`--to` (source/destination
  participant; `--from == --to` is a self-message) and `--label` (the message
  text). Optional: `--message-type` (`sync` default | `reply` | `async` |
  `lost`); `--from-type`/`--to-type` (`participant` default | `actor` |
  `database` | `boundary`); `--group 'kind:label'` (`loop`/`opt`/`alt`/`par` —
  contiguous rows with the same value become one frame) plus `--group-branch`
  for an else/and compartment inside that frame (groups are single-level, no
  nesting); `--autonumber` numbers the messages. Message order follows row
  order (`ORDER BY`); participant order follows first appearance, and a
  participant's type is fixed by the type on the row where it first appears.
  Every sequence tile gets a **mermaid** button that copies a mermaid.js
  `sequenceDiagram` to the clipboard — since mermaid has no database/boundary
  shape, those export as `participant` with a preceding `%% database`/
  `%% boundary` comment (`actor` exports as `actor`). Keep to **~6
  participants** (fixed-width columns); split a larger flow into several tiles.
- **Bar fill**: `--bars solid` gives each bar its own palette colour — use it for
  categorical x (methods, status codes, regions). `--bars gradient` (default for a
  single series) suits continuous/over-time data. Colours come from the theme.
- **Caption every chart** with `--caption` (required, not optional) — one line on
  what it shows and the so-what. Pair with `--title` and `--xlabel`/`--ylabel` so
  the panel is self-explanatory; add an adjacent markdown panel for a longer
  description.
- **Daily reporting from timestamps**: bucket to a `DATE` in the view (e.g.
  `ts::DATE AS day` or `date_trunc('week', ts)::DATE`) so there's one row per day
  and bars land on day boundaries — don't plot raw timestamps for per-day charts.
- **Event markers update live**: re-post a tile with the same `--name` plus new
  `--event`/`--target` flags to add or change its markers in place.
- **Sessions are portable**: `session export` bundles the dashboard, full
  snapshots of every database its tiles reference, and their column formats
  into `<name>.muckdb` (a zip); `session import` loads one on any machine (db
  copies land under the data dir in `imports/<id>/`; a name collision gets a
  `-2` suffix). The web UI has an **export** button on the session view and an
  **import** button in the top header.
- `stacked` is a stacked bar: pass multiple `--y` columns (one per series) and
  one row per `--x`; the series stack into each bar's total. Shape the view so
  each series is its own column (e.g. `sum(amount) FILTER (category = 'X')`).
- **Reference lines & markers — use them to draw the eye.** `--target`/`--threshold`
  draw horizontal lines at a y-value (anchor a series against an SLA/budget/limit);
  `--event` draws a vertical line at an x-position (timestamp or category) and is
  the best way to flag an important moment — a deploy, incident, or campaign. Add
  one to essentially every time series. Each is `VALUE` or `VALUE|label`, e.g.
  `--threshold '30|max'`.
- **Trendline — `--trend`** overlays a smoothed trendline (locally-weighted
  regression) on a single-series `bar`/`line`/`area`/`scatter` tile — add it by
  default to records/metric-over-time charts. Ignored on stacked/multi-series tiles.

## Column display formats — set them, always

**Format every numeric column that has a unit.** A bare `4343.33` makes the human
guess (dollars? ms? a count?); `$4,343.33 USD` answers it. Make it a standard step
right after you build your views and before posting tiles — one command per column,
applies everywhere it appears.

Attach a unit/currency/decimal format to a column so facets, charts, stats and
tables render it nicely (e.g. `$4,343.33 USD`):

```
muckdb format <db> <column> [--table T] [--currency USD | --prefix $ --suffix ' USD' --decimals N --thousands --percent] [--tz local|utc|Area/City] [--epoch s|ms|us] [--link URL] [--link-title T] [--clear]
muckdb format list [<db>]
```

A registry entry keyed by column name applies wherever that column appears
(including derived view columns charts plot); `--table` scopes it to one
relation — use the name a tile actually queries (the **view** you post, not the
base table under it). Formats also read from a DuckDB column comment
(`COMMENT ON COLUMN t.c IS 'muckdb:{"prefix":"$","decimals":2,"group":true}'`),
which travels with the database; the registry overrides the comment.

**Timestamps.** Naive DB timestamps are treated as UTC instants. `--tz local`
(or `utc`, or an IANA zone like `Australia/Brisbane`) shows a timestamp column
in that zone in tables, facets and stats — and a chart with that column on x
draws its time axis in the same zone. Without a `--tz`, time axes render the
UTC wall clock so daily/hourly buckets stay on their boundaries. `--epoch
s|ms|us` marks a numeric column as an epoch so it displays and charts as time
(columns with time-ish names and plausible epoch values are auto-detected).
Time axes are granularity-aware: DATE or midnight-truncated columns never show
hour ticks, first-of-month data ticks monthly, and hourly axes get a bold date
label at each day boundary.

**Links — `--link` / `--link-title`.** Turn a column's cells into hyperlinks
(rendered in the rows view, query results and session `table` tiles; visible in
the schema tab's format column). **Add a link to every column where it makes
sense, as routinely as you format numeric columns** — any id/uuid/slug/reference
that maps to an admin portal, ticket, repo, PR, dashboard or object store turns a
flat table into a launchpad. Both flags take a **template** with the same
substitution system:

```sh
muckdb format app.db user_uuid \
  --link 'https://admin.example.com/companies/{company_uuid}/users/{value}' \
  --link-title 'user {value}'
```

- `{value}` — this column's value; `{any_column}` — the value of **any other
  column in the same row** (e.g. inject a company uuid *and* a user uuid into
  one URL, as above).
- **Encoding**: in `--link` every substitution is percent-encoded by default —
  append `:raw` (`{path:raw}`) to inject verbatim (a column that already holds
  a path/query fragment). In `--link-title` substitutions are verbatim by
  default — append `:url` (`{q:url}`) to percent-encode. Both modifiers work
  in both templates.
- A `{name}` matching no column is left as literal text; NULLs substitute as
  empty strings. `--link-title` is optional — the link text defaults to the
  column's (formatted) value, so `--currency USD --link ...` shows a clickable
  `$1,234.56 USD`.
- As a column comment: `muckdb:{"link":"https://…/{value}","link_title":"open {name}"}`.

## Inspecting state (read it back as JSON)

To understand what muckdb is currently showing — without starting the server —
use the read-only `ls` commands. They print JSON, so you can parse them:

```
muckdb ls databases          # [{id, path, exists}] for every db muckdb has seen
muckdb ls tables <db>         # tables + views in a database ({name, is_view, ...})
muckdb ls sessions           # every session with its tiles
muckdb ls session <id>       # one session (tiles: names, types, charts, views)
muckdb ls history [--limit N]  # the command ledger (args, exit codes, session tag)
```

Use these to check a session's current tiles before updating one, to find a
database's `id` (for building a `/db/<id>/…` link), or to see what the human has
been running.

**See what the human actually looks at.** Session JSON from `ls sessions` /
`ls session <id>` includes an `activity` block recorded from the web UI:
per-session `views`/`last_viewed`, and per-tile `zooms`/`explores`/`last`.
Use it to adapt: a session with many views is worth keeping polished; a tile
the human zooms or explores repeatedly deserves more depth; a tile with zero
interactions across many views is a hint to present that data differently.

## Screenshots — see what you built

`muckdb session screenshot <name> [--tile TILE] [--out F.png]` renders the
session (or one tile) exactly as the web UI shows it and writes a PNG — read the
file to check your dashboard looks right. Omit `--tile` for the whole dashboard;
the height auto-fits the content. Needs a Chromium-based browser (chromium/
chrome/brave/edge, or `MUCKDB_BROWSER=/path`). The same render is available as
`GET /api/shot?session=<id>&tile=<name>` (`image/png`) and behind the copy-image
button on every panel in the web UI. The web UI header also has a **poster**
button that downloads a single PNG of the whole dashboard (rendered in-browser),
and **table tiles have a full-width toggle** (the horizontal-expand icon) that
breaks the tile out of the centred column so every column is visible.

## Good habits

- **Keep session databases somewhere durable.** Tiles keep pointing at the
  `--db` path they were posted with; a db created under `/tmp` or a session
  scratchpad breaks the dashboard ("database does not exist") when that dir is
  cleaned. Use the project dir or a stable data dir (e.g.
  `~/.local/share/muckdb/data/`) — `session tile` warns on temp paths.
- **Aggregate in SQL, not in the chart.** A tile plots rows as-is, so write the
  view to return exactly the series you want (`GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, a sensible
  `LIMIT`).
- **Order columns most-filterable first, view-only last.** The explorer shows and
  facets columns in `SELECT` order, so lead with the dimensions a human actually
  filters on (status, category, region, name, dates, amounts) and push columns
  that can't be meaningfully filtered to the end — `latitude`/`longitude` (only
  useful on a map) and bare `id`/`uuid` (for viewing/linking, not filtering). Order
  as *filter dimensions → measures → id/coords last*, not `id` first out of habit.
- **Caption and label every tile.** Always pass `--caption`, and on charts
  `--title`/`--xlabel`/`--ylabel` — an unlabelled panel isn't done.
- **Format numeric columns before posting tiles.** Set a `muckdb format` for every
  money/duration/rate/count column a panel will show — see "Column display formats".
- **Link id/reference columns** in the same pass — add a `--link` to every column
  that identifies or references something openable (uuid → admin portal, ticket →
  tracker, repo/PR, object key → storage), so its cells are clickable.
- **Markdown for narrative, charts for data.** Lead with a markdown summary tile
  (prose + a markdown table of the key figures), then supporting chart tiles.
  Never dump raw rows into chat — summarise in a markdown panel and put the data
  in a chart or explorable view tile beside it.
- **Update, don't duplicate.** Keep `--name`s stable across a task; the dashboard
  updates live (WebSocket) each time you post.
- **Respect the trash.** The human can trash a panel in the UI; the flag persists
  on the tile (`trashed: true` in `muckdb ls session`) and survives re-posts —
  updating a trashed tile does not resurface it. Delete for real with
  `muckdb session rm <session> --tile <name>`.
- **Look at what you built.** `muckdb session screenshot <id> [--tile T]` gives
  you a PNG of the rendered dashboard — read it and check the charts say what
  you think they say before telling the human it's done.
- **Give the human the link.** `http://localhost:11000/session/<id>/` — deep-links
  to a specific table/view/query also work, e.g.
  `/db/<id>/<table>/?view=stats` (stats tabs: `&tab=correlation|timeseries|junk`).
- Queries the daemon runs (introspection, tiles, the editor) are **read-only**.

## Where state lives

Sessions are JSON files under the muckdb data dir
(`~/.local/share/muckdb/sessions/` on Linux,
`~/Library/Application Support/muckdb/sessions/` on macOS); the command ledger is
`history.jsonl` beside it. The CLI writes; the daemon watches and pushes updates.

## Developing muckdb (keep CI green)

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs, in order, on every push/PR across
ubuntu + macos: `cargo fmt --check` → `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
→ `cargo build` → `cargo test`. `fmt --check` is strict and is the most common
cause of red — committing code that hasn't been run through `cargo fmt` fails the
whole job.

**Before committing any Rust change, always run these and only commit once they
pass clean:**

```sh
cargo fmt              # not --check — actually format the tree
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

A tracked pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs `cargo fmt` and re-stages
any reformatted `.rs` files so the format check can't go red. `core.hooksPath` is
per-clone local config, so enable it once after cloning:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Cutting a release (binaries + Homebrew)

**Plain pushes to `main` do NOT build a release** — they only run CI. The release
workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`: build macOS+Linux binaries → create the
GitHub release → bump the Homebrew tap formula) fires **only on a pushed `v*`
tag**. So after merging changes you want to ship, you must cut a tagged release —
it won't happen on its own.

Use **`cargo release`** (the `cargo-release` crate, configured by `release.toml`).
It does the whole flow in one command — bump `Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock`, make the
`chore: release X.Y.Z` commit, tag it `vX.Y.Z`, and push the branch + tag (which is
what fires `release.yml`). `release.toml` sets `publish = false` so it never
touches crates.io.

```sh
cargo install cargo-release      # one-time, if not already installed

# Working tree must be clean first (cargo release refuses with uncommitted changes).
cargo release patch              # dry-run: shows the plan, changes nothing
cargo release patch --execute    # actually bump + commit + tag + push
#            ^ patch | minor | major, or an exact version e.g. `cargo release 0.2.0`
```

Then confirm the build started with `gh run list --workflow=release.yml`.

The convention is **one bump commit per release, and that commit is what gets
tagged** (the `vX.Y.Z` tag points at the commit that sets `version = "X.Y.Z"`) —
`cargo release` produces exactly that. Commit any other changes *before* releasing
so the release commit contains only the version bump.

Manual fallback (if `cargo release` is unavailable) — same end result:

```sh
# 1. Bump the version in BOTH Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock (the [[package]] muckdb entry).
git commit -am "chore: release X.Y.Z"        # 2. commit just the bump
git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z   # 3. tag + push
```

`git push` alone does not push tags — push the tag explicitly. Check the latest
released version with `git tag --sort=-creatordate | head` (and `git describe
--tags` shows how many commits HEAD is ahead of the last tag).
